###FontLabs

# Wot is dis???
For some reason there is no simple way to use custom fonts on StreamLabs alerts so we decided to make our own tool to do just that! 

# K, how 2 use?????
In the Streamlabs settings theres a CSS editor for the fonts, simply just copy paste the results from our tool into the Streamlabs CSS editor & see the magic happen!!!

#Thats pretty cool!! Is there any way I can support you?
